# Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset
This repository contains a Python project that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to classify Iris species based on sepal and petal measurements. The project includes data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `Iris.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `decision_tree_model.pkl`: The saved Decision Tree model.
- `decision_tree.png`: The visualization of the trained Decision Tree.
- `decision_tree.py`: The main script for loading data, training the model, making predictions, and visualizing results.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You also need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pydotplus pillow joblib
